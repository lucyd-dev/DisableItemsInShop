As the title already tells, this mod let you disabling the use of certain items. No more flying items across the shop or wasted util in your lobby.\
If you like my mod, I would really appreciate if you leave a like ðŸ’œ

### Disable Custom Items

- Needs to be a comma-separated list
- Only works for toggleable items like the guns, mines, etc.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use a mod manager like Gale, you can change the .cfg settings in the launcher itself or you can use [REPOConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/nickklmao/REPOConfig/) to change it directly ingame.\
> In order for the .cfg file to appear, you must launch the game once after installing/updating the mod!
