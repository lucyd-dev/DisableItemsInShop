As the title already tells, this mod disables using items inside the shop. No more flying items across the room.\
If you like my mod, I would very appreciate if u leave a like ðŸ’œ

## Configuration

If you only want to disable grenades & mines in the shop, then change "OnlyExplosives" to "true" (default is false)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use a mod manager like Gale, you can change the .cfg settings in the launcher itself.\
>  In order for the .cfg file to appear, you must launch the game once after installing the mod!
