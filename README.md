As the title already tells, this mod disables using items inside the shop. No more flying items across the room.\
If you like my mod, I would very appreciate if u leave a like ðŸ’œ

## Configuration

- Set where you want to disable items (default is "Shop")
- Disable only grenades & mines (default is false)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use a mod manager like Gale, you can change the .cfg settings in the launcher itself or you can use [REPOConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/nickklmao/REPOConfig/) to change it directly ingame.\
> In order for the .cfg file to appear, you must launch the game once after installing/updating the mod!
